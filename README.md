# MatlabTobiiGlassesPro2
Code that uses the Tobii API to pull live stream data for use in Psychophysics

Currently just code to look at the head response by using the Gyroscope and Accelerometer data
Also code to calibrate the head response (making sure the angle the subject is looking is the correct response angle)
Calibration code will integrate with aruduino (to control LEDs)
